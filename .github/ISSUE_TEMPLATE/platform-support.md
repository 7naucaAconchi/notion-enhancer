**platform**
what system are you on? (e.g. windows, macOS, raspbian, xfce)

**installation steps**
how did you install notion?
please link me to the download/installer/wrapper you used.

**filepaths**
- where is notion installed
- what file structure does it have
- in particular, where is the `app.asar` file

**why?**
what's so special about this way of installing notion?
is there any particular reason why you can't use one of the already-supported clients?
