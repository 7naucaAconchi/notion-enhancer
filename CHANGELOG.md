# changelog

if something is ~~crossed out~~, then it is no longer a feature included by default,
but can still easily be enabled by following instructions in the [docs](README.md).

### v0.8.0 (wip)

complete rewrite with node.js.

- new: simpler cli installation system (inc. commands: `apply`, `remove`, and `check`).
- new: mod loading system (easier to create new mods, adds to notion rather than overwriting).
- new: mod configuration menu.
- improved: more theming variable coverage - inc. light theme and sizing/spacing.
- bugfix: non-reproducable errors with python.
- bugfix: better launcher patching on linux.
- bugfix: fix frameless window issue introduced by notion desktop 2.0.9.
- extension: "custom inserts" = link files for small client-side tweaks..
- extension: "bracketed links" = render links surrounded with \[\[brackets]] instead of underlined.
- extension: "focus mode" = hide the titlebar/menubar if the sidebar is closed (will be shown on hover).
- theme: "neutral" = smoother colours and fonts, designed to be more pleasing to the eye.
- theme: "dark+" = a vivid-colour near-black theme.

//todo

- extension: "emojiset" = pick from a variety of emoji styles to use.
- extension: "night light" = sync dark/light theme with the system.

### v0.7.0 (2020-07-09)

- new: tray option to use system default emojis (instead of twitter's emojiset).
- new: mac support (identical functionality to others platforms with the
  exception of the native minimise/maximise/close buttons being kept, as they integrate
  better with the OS while not being out-of-place in notion).
- new: notion-deb-builder support for linux.
- improved: replaced button symbols with svgs for multi-platform support.
- improved: window close button is now red on hover (thanks to [@torchatlas](https://github.com/torchatlas)).

- new: custom colour theming, demonstrated via the dark+ theme.
- new: linux support (thanks to [@Blacksuan19](https://github.com/Blacksuan19)).
- improved: if hotkey is pressed while notion is unfocused, it will bring it to the front rather than hiding it.
- improved: stop window buttons breaking at smaller widths.
- improved: more obviously visible drag area.
- bugfix: specify UTF-8 encoding to prevent multibyte/gbk codec errors (thanks to [@etnperlong](https://github.com/etnperlong)).
