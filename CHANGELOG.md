# changelog

if something is ~~crossed out~~, then it is no longer a feature included by default,
but can still easily be enabled by following instructions in the [docs](README.md).

### v0.6.1 (wip)

- new: mac support (identical functionality to others platforms with the
  exception of the native minimise/maximise/close buttons being kept, as they integrate
  better with the OS while not being out-of-place in notion).
- improved: replaced button symbols with svgs for multi-platform support.
- improved: window close button is now red on hover (thanks to [@torchatlas](https://github.com/torchatlas)).
- bugfix: `cleaner.py` patched for linux.
- bugfix: tray now operates as expected on linux.
- bugfix: odd mix of `\\` and `/` being used for windows filepaths.
- bugfix: app no longer crashes when sidebar is toggled.

known remaining/confirmed issues:

- russian symbols not supported by UTF-8

- style: custom fonts.
- style: font resizing.
- style: hide discussions (thanks to [u/Roosmaryn](https://www.reddit.com/user/Roosmaryn/)).
- new: custom colour theming, demonstrated via the dark+ theme.
- new: linux support (thanks to [@Blacksuan19](https://github.com/Blacksuan19)).
- improved: if hotkey is pressed while notion is unfocused, it will bring it to the front rather than hiding it.
- improved: stop window buttons breaking at smaller widths.
- improved: more obviously visible drag area.
- bugfix: specify UTF-8 encoding to prevent multibyte/gbk codec errors (thanks to [@etnperlong](https://github.com/etnperlong)).
